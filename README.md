# This is a 5.3.1 unity project made in my first year at humber. overhauled it myself as it was origianly mario and dicided to use heroes of might and magic 3 assets to make it my own
# its one of my unique ideas a 2d scroller where you need to keep going foward because death is chasing you, avoid or defeat enemies and defeat the boss to win
